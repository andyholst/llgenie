"""Every issue body this repository files carries the goal, then the technical solution (issue #745).

A reader who was not in the run that filed an issue must be able to answer four questions — what is
broken, why it matters, what the fix is, what it buys — before any file path appears. The PR body
already has that rule and a gate (`scripts/check_pr_hygiene.py`); the issue is one artifact earlier in
the pipeline, and it is what the implementer starts from. This gate makes the rule real:

  check_issue_body.py check    exit 1 on any defect below
  check_issue_body.py report   print the producer roster, the skill state and the verdict

Findings:

- a producer in `scripts/issue_body.py::PRODUCERS` that does not import `issue_body` and call
  `issue_body.render(` — a second shape, which is the defect, not a style choice;
- a producer that writes a section heading (`## Problem`, `## Why it matters`, `## How we fix it`,
  `## Benefit`, `## Not covered`, `## Technical`) into its own source: the renderer is the one place
  those are spelled;
- `AGENTS.md` without the section that states the rule (so deleting the rule is a red gate, exactly
  as `check_pr_authors` treats its own section);
- `.hermes/skills/issue-triage/SKILL.md` or `.hermes/skills/issue-refiner/SKILL.md` no longer naming
  the five sections in their `REFINED:` / `RESTATED:` output block;
- a renderer whose own output does not pass its own `missing()` (the renderer and the checker must
  agree, or the gate proves nothing).

Stdlib only: `make ci-unit` runs it on a bare host.
